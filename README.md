Elizabeth Amaihian Moving Bird Final Edit 1
# Moving Bird



A simulation for an automated Bird in Unity Development. This project implements a simple-reflex agent in this environment.


 

# Performance measure 
- How much energy is used



# What you will see when you run the simulation...

1. First, notice how the bird move at different rate. 

2. The bird is moving to the front and also moving back to its point.  

3. Wait for the point where the bird is satisfied with the job it has done in the first two tiles.
It will then move around and stop again.

4. So, the bot will go into turbo mode - which will spam warning messages in the console telling you that is turbo mode.  To make this easier to see you may,
  want to toggle the normal debug messages in the unity editor.

6. Then it will move on to the next tile. you will Notice that the bot goes into turbo mode only on the tile but quickly switches off to normal mode when it moves off it. 
That's because turbo mode has a lower efficiency rate.

7. and lastly it prefers to be in normal mode whenever it can.
